# Website filter extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that can put colour filters on web pages (including PDFs).

#### Installation and how to use

1. Download 'Website_filter_ext' (located in this repository) and unzip the folder.
2. On Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner of the window, and navigate to 'Extensions'. Click 'Manage Extensions', and you are taken to the page containing all of your current extensions.
3. In the top right corner, switch on the toggle for 'Developer mode'. Click on the button saying 'Load unpacked' and select the unzipped folder. 

At the top of the browser, click on the 'Extensions' icon and pin the extension (its logo is an emoji of a computer with books on its screen). You can use the filter when the icon is clicked.
